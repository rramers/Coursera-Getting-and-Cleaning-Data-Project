#Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Project

###This repository contains details of the course project

##Data used in the project
### The UCI HAR Dataset was downloaded for use in this project
### The data was collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone
### There are two sets of files, test files and training files. Each of these sets of files contain an unlabeled feature file and a file with activity levels.

##Purpose of the script
### The script run_analysis does the following:
###1 Merges the training and the test data into one set
###2 Extracts the mean and standard deviation for each measurement in the file
###3 Names the activities in the data set with descriptive names
###4 Labels the data set with descriptive variable names
###5 Creates a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
### The resulting data set, tidy.txt, is included in this repository

###The Code Book

###The CodeBook.md file in the repository shows the transformations performed and the resulting data and variables.
